This is because it is difficult to learn, at least with any consistency, the features of underrepresented classes. The scores for **higher-support classes** are more interesting, with the **f1 scores for 'money-fx' at about 0.81, 'trade' at about 0.84, 'acq' at about 0.90, and 'earn' -- with the highest support -- at about 0.97**. Perhaps more interesting is that the model was able to predict the created class, 'none', with an f1 score of about 0.88. This was interesting to me because it means there are learnable features of entries that indicate they should fall outside the scope of the given classification scheme. If I were to pursue this further, I would certainly analyze these results using PCA and tSNE to identify the confusion of each class with each other.

and capturing all instances of 'not-earn' was almost perfect, whereas the top-right cell indicates that several entries were also labeled 'not-earn' which should have been 'earn'. I think this is likely due to the issue alluded to earlier that with so many varieties of 'not-earn' entries, and such a high number of them, some are bound to be close enough to 'earn' entries that it is hard to tell them apart. Further research would be on that shared, fuzzy boundary -- where, and in what manner, it shows up. It could be that some entries are mislabeled; it could be that there is some shared vocabulary; it could be that there is additional information that could help separate the two (as in the other sgm labels).
